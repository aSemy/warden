# Warden

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lgwillmore/warden.svg?branch=master)

A kotlin implementation of light weight Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).

ABAC is an approach to defining and enforcing authorization rules.

The rules can be built based on the attributes of any of the entities involved with any given action. As such, any conceivable rule or policy can be configured.

For more information about the general concepts, you can check out the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)

## Aims of this project

 - Be lightweight
